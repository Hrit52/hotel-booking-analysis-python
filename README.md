This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) of over 100,000 hotel booking records to uncover key insights into customer behavior, reservation patterns, and operational factors that impact booking outcomes.

# Objective:
To analyze hotel booking data and generate actionable insights that can help improve guest segmentation, reduce cancellations, and optimize resource planning.

# Key Analyses Performed:
Total bookings and cancellation rate breakdown

Guest segmentation based on marital status, children, and babies

Stay duration patterns for both resort and city hotels

Parking preferences and meal plan choices

Comparison of canceled vs. confirmed bookings

Seasonality and lead time trends

# Visualizations:
Bar plots showing top booking channels and guest types

Heatmaps illustrating correlation between numerical features

Line plots for reservation trends over time

Distribution plots for stay duration and lead time

# Insights Gained:
Families and married couples showed a higher rate of confirmed bookings compared to solo travelers.

City hotels had shorter average stays and more last-minute bookings than resort hotels.

A large number of bookings with no assigned parking, suggesting a potential upselling opportunity.

Peak cancellations occurred when lead times were unusually long.

# Outcome:
This project demonstrates the application of data cleaning, feature engineering, and visual storytelling to extract business value from raw booking data.
